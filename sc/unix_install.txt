Installing ShakeCast on a UNIX-Based Platform
    This document outlines the process of installing ShakeCast on a platform
    that runs a UNIX-based operating system such as FreeBSD, Linux or
    Solaris.

  MySQL Database

    1   Install MySQL -- We have tested with 4.0.16 on Windows and 4.0.17 on
        FreeBSD. The ShakeCast application requires features not present
        before 4.0 so you will need that release at a minimum. Make sure you
        have plenty of free space on the partition where you install the
        data files.

    2   Create the 'sc' database -- connect to mysql as root or another
        privileged user and execute the following:

                mysql> grant usage on *.* to sc@localhost identified by 'sc';
                mysql> grant all privileges on sc.* to sc@localhost;

    3   Build the schema and populate lookup tables -- Two SQL scripts are
        supplied. The 'sc-create.sql' script contains commands to create all
        the schema objects (tables and indexes). The 'sc-data.sql' script
        populates the lookup tables with their predefined contents.

                mysql -u sc -psc sc < sc-create.sql
                mysql -u sc -psc sc < sc-data.sql

    4   Secure your MySQL installation to meet the requirements of your
        organization.

  Application

    1   Create the application directory root -- the application root is
        /usr/local/sc on FreeBSD. You might want to create a separate user
        to own the application and perform the following steps logged in as
        that user

    2   Restore the application tree -- the application itself is delivered
        as a tarball that should be untarred into /usr/local/sc.

    3   Various systems have different paths to the Perl interpreter. All of
        the ShakeCast scripts use /usr/local/sc/sc.bin/perl as the path. So
        that this will work, you need to make a soft link, such as

          ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/local/sc/sc.bin

  Apache Configuration

    1   Install Apache -- we use 1.3.29.

    2   Configure for ShakeCast -- In the 'conf' subdirectory you will find
        httpd.conf and httpd-sc.conf. The former is based on the distributed
        httpd.conf with the minimum amount of changes, and includes
        httpd-sc.conf, which has essentially all the directives for the
        ShakeCast site. Also included is httpd.diff, which is a diff of
        httpd.conf from the distributed one (you can see what we changed).

        It is very likely that your Apache install will not be exactly like
        ours so you might need to do some tweaking of either the httpd.conf
        that we supply or your own to get things to work.

    3   User authentication -- we provide a user password file that contains
        one user (scadmin). The initial password is also 'scadmin'. You
        should change this using the htpasswd utility that comes with
        Apache.

    4   Test the server -- Try to view the page

               http://yourhostname/scripts/c/printenv.pl

        Log in using the admin account or another you have set up. If you
        get a page titled "Report Output" then you have set up Apache at
        least mostly correctly.

  Daemon Processes

    ShakeCast uses a daemon process to communicate with other servers and to
    queue and deliver notifications. So that these processes are started
    automatically when the system is brought up multi-user, copy the
    contents of the sc/rc.d directory into /usr/local/etc/rc.d (or its
    equivalent).
