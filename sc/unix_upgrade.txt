Upgrading a UNIX-Based ShakeCast Installation
    You should follow these instructions if you are currently running
    Version 20040830-01 or 20040830-02 of ShakeCast.

  Stop the Daemon Processes

    The ShakeCast daemons should be stopped by

      cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d
      ./sc-dispd.sh stop
      ./sc-polld.sh stop
      ./sc-notify.sh stop
      ./sc-notifyqueue.sh stop

  Restoring the Tarball

    Restoring the new version will overwrite and replace many files in the
    "/usr/local/sc" directory. In particular, all templates and the database
    of Apache login ID's will be replaced. Be sure that you have made a
    backup of this directory before proceding.

    A possible sequence of upgrade steps is:

    1   Make a backup of "/usr/local/sc".

    2   If you have made local changes to any of the distributed templates,
        rename the "templates" directory to "templates.old".

    3   Rename the "userdbs" directory to "userdbs.old".

    4   Restore the tarball by something like

          cd /usr/local/sc
          tar xvzf sc-deliver.tgz

        assuming that the tarball is in "/usr/local".

    5   If you made local changes to templates, merge these from the
        "templates.old" directory back to the "templates" directory.

    6   Replace the contents of "userdbs" with the contents of "userdbs.old"

    7   Various systems have different paths to the Perl interpreter. All of
        the ShakeCast scripts use /usr/local/sc/sc.bin/perl as the path. So
        that this will work, you need to make a soft link, such as

          ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/local/sc/sc.bin

  Restart the Daemon Processes

    The ShakeCast daemons may be restarted by

      cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d
      ./sc-dispd.sh start
      ./sc-polld.sh start
      ./sc-notify.sh start
      ./sc-notifyqueue.sh start
